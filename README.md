# Hack the Caesar Cipher


    ● To encrypt a message use Caesar Cipher, you will encrypt each alphabe character in message.

    ● To encrypt a character, you will replace the original character by a new character.
    
    ● The new character is found from original one by just shift original a number of time on alphabe table. The number of shift is called KEY. For example, if KEY = 3, “A” character will become “D” as show up above table.

    ● Using above rules, message “I love programming” will become “L oryh surjudpplqj”

**Automate Encrpyt**

Using python programming language, we will transfer sequent of encrypt to a program with
following notes:

    ● Using for in loop to access every character inside a string
    
    ● Using upper() function to make all character inside string become upper case
    
    ● Using find() function to findout character position inside string
    
    ● Using len() global function to get length of string
    
    ● Access character inside string with index
